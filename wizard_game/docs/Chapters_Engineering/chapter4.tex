\chapter{Testing}
For the testing aspect of this project it was decided to use the Junit package to test some of the functionality of the game with it AI. There will also be the use of Unit testing to check to see if the if the project has passed the basic needs for it to function properly. As the game was more create for the use of the Monte Carlo Tree search, testing with people to check it replay ability and how fun it was to play was not need.
\subsection{Unit Testing}
Junit was used during and after the project was fully functional to test the different aspect of the game that needed to work properly to ensure that it was up to standard. This involved create different Test classes to check each of the part. This test was mainly built to test the more vital parts of the system as if the core classes weren’t working properly, the more complex aspects wouldn’t either. This classed involved were:
\begin{itemize}
\item CardTest - To test that the card contains the suit, value and number that has been inputted.
\item DeckTest -
\item MonteCarloTreeSearchTest -
\item RoundTest-
\Item RuleTest-
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Manual Testing}
There was also the use of manually testing the game. This was done by playing the game to see if anything unusual or unexpected would happen such an invalid card being played. This was made easier to diagnose use the Intellij$'$s debugger so the problem could be found quickly. This shone light onto the problem of the user being able to enter a letter, symbol or number that was invalid for the bid or play card. This could be fixed by either allowing the input of the name of the card as it displayed on the console or doing a loop to show an error until a valid input can be accepted.
